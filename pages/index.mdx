        This page has been auto-generated by TryCereals. It uses MDX, an authorable format
        that mixes Markdown and React components. How cool is that?

A lot has happened!

First, you created an app on TryCereals. It created a starter repository, from this content (an MDX file).
It then pushed it on a private Git repository, and created a Netlify site on your behalf. to finish, it connected the two
and triggered a new deployment!

ðŸ‘†this means I'm super happy you landed there!
